# 4-pin SPI for ST7567 LCD
### _initializing code_

For displaying graphics on a LCD, or for any communication, there are some protocols like UART, I2C and SPI, out of which we would use 4-pin SPI with single slave (ST7567 LCD). For the project I did at Livguard, R5F100FC microcontroller was used with ENH-DG128064-185-YFNTKF Graphical LCD, using Renesas E1 (Serial) programmer and CS+ for CC.

- Install Renesas CS+ for CC (version 8.07)
- Select RL78 family & R5F100FC microcontroller
- Save the files and then build the project
- Connect the programmer and power to the PCB
- Download the project and run it
